Loren Britton and Pritchard introduce [[For Careful Slugs-BrittonPritchard.pdf|this]] speculative text as an act of unknowing. Unknowing is a labour of creating knowledge otherwise, rather than simply the refrain from acting upon previous (conditioned or assumed) knowledge. Unknowing is not forgetting, but an intervention into the knowledge.

Further research:: I wonder where unknowing as a practice "comes form"?
