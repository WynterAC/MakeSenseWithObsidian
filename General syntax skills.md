- Notes
- Thoughts
- Readings

- Plans
- Code
- Recipes

## Basic Syntax

#### Now we will look at some basic markdown code for obsidian.

# Headings!

### And Headings!!!

That enable you to break up notes into sections and structure many levels of subheadings.

## Tagging

This is similar to social media tagging but you set the agenda!

---

### You simply use a `#` and word to create tags between documents.

These can be #inline or in page metadata (info about a note).

---

### You can also tag within annotations!

You can annotate essays easily with tags and keep track of trends!

like [THESE NOTES](../../../../ResearchðŸ’­/Reading%20ðŸ“–/Johanna%20Hedva/Sick%20Woman%20Theory.md)

---

## Why organise like this?

Because then you can start to see and search through you information in a much clearer way.

---

### As well as Graph view

That enables you to see a mapping of the data.

## Quick not on Addons

Their are soooo many!

And they can help to transform what obsidian is able to do.
From:
- annotating pdfs
- download sub tracks from videos
- auto downloading recipes
- saving webpages for later
- organising you TODos
- And much more!

---

## On your own  for 2 mins try to come up with some use cases.

At the end we will aim to feedback to the group!
