# Situating "make sense with Obsidian"
## Knowledge base & Research Collection
Our uses of this tool, being within the context of research, note-taking and visualising knowledge. Also a centralisation and management system of notes & ideas -- "Linking your thinking".

## Why we have a knowledge base:
- The practice of organising knowledge
- Learning to create helpful way-finding, especially neuroüçÆdivergent learning & rhythms 
- Non-compartmentalising and creating a trans‚≠êdisciplinary knowledge practice
- Emptying my brain, not having to remember everything
- Sorting through information overload & overwhelm, creating steps, routines, cycles

## Why Obsidian
We are NOT working for Obsidian, and it is a proprietary tool. but it is an _open_ proprietary tool with a big and helpful community who create plugins/addons that make it super flexible and adaptable to many uses and contexts. (you can make your own plugins too very easily!)

Sandbox: very customisable & allows low-level access to potentially change _everything_ about the interface and how you use it. In this workshop we will use templates and community-made plugins, and even customise the interface with themes.

Local & not a subscription: by default everything is saved locally, not cloud dependant. They do offer a synching service between devices, this is the only paid service. There are synching alternatives that are free and not-cloud based [[README#Extra & Cool|Look in here]].

# What we're doing today

Cultivating a knowledge base takes time (G: 1.5 years, B: 3 years) but today we will create a small constellation of notes and files to create a starting point that you can expand on. 

Showing different methods of using the same functionalities, we will see this with using tags, meta-data, annotation, writing styles and linking. How we are using the analogy of the constellation; how does creating tags and systems inform the structure of the constellation?
