- Bullet points
	- With nested bullet points

# How much detail is too much
We've made a very verbose tutorial vault with very detailed steps. Do you feel like some steps could/should have been left for more intuitive exploration from you? If so, which ones?

# Visual aids
Did you find the screenshots helpful, or would you prefer when we demo going to these screens with you?

You can write your questions on this pad, any thoughts and feelings will be very helpful.
