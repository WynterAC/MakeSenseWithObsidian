# Components to Introduce

This gives an overview of how the we are approaching creating a constellation of knowledge throughout the workshop. Through introducing the interface we will ad layers of complexity and skills whilst also showing a guide to how they might practice a knowledge base for themselves. As this workshop is fairly short for the amount of content, it is about opening doors for them to go through in the future and in their own way.

# Monday Afternoon

## Intro

### Knowledge Bases
In this session we are introducing the concept of knowledge bases, and the use of obsidian in this spectrum of these software and tools. We will introduce how we can practice and adapt these flexible tools to work within  many approaches to note taking, reading and organising your knowledge and research. 

### Making Sense with Obsidian

We will then introduce the concepts of the workshop where we will use basic functionalities of obsidian to formulate a small configurations of knowledge, formed from connected notes on your selected media or papers. This will come together with the basic skills we have show to explore how themes, tags and connections can create new and generative ways of exploring their research.

> 2. Create an index or overview in each new directory to explain what it is. Remember you can use a template so they are all the same format, and then you can add tags, link them to related files and write some info about them.
> 3. Maybe even start to add some existing research into the vault and place them in the relevant folders.
