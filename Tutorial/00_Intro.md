# Situating "Making Sense with Obsidian"

## Pre-word (Share notes!)

We find shared note taking really helpful so we have setup a pad in [[Shared notes and questions]] note, with subheadings for each section already setup.

## Knowledge base & Research Collection

What is a Knowledge base? 

Well it basically just a simple term for a centralised system to collect, compile and work through your knowledge collection!

Our uses of this tool, in the context of research:
- note-taking
- A centralisation and management system of notes & ideas.
- using links, connections and data to create your groupings, rhythms and movements within notes. 
- Using different modes like visualising knowledge. 
- Relating knowledge to other knowledge, not just to when and where you learned it.

## Why we personally have a knowledge base:

We will go a bit more into this on the second day, but we find it really beneficial to practice our own methods for collating and collecting our research and knowledge! This is a way to actively practice your knowledge making instead of defaulting to existing systems, as it lets us learn what works for us and what doesn't.

- To practice organising our own knowledge, and seeing how that feels‚≠êworks
- Learning to create helpful way-finding, especially nueroüçÆdivergent learning & rhythms 
- Non-compartmentalising and creating a trans‚≠êdisciplinary knowledge practice
- Emptying my brain, not having to remember everything
- Sorting through information overload & overwhelm, creating steps, routines, cycles that we can catch ourselves with

## Why Obsidian
We are NOT working for Obsidian, and it is a proprietary tool. It is an _open_ proprietary tool with a big and helpful community who create plugins/addons that make it super flexible and adaptable to many uses and contexts. (you can make your own plugins too very easily!) The files are also all in [[01_General syntax|markdown]] so are easily transferred to another markdown (md) based software (there are many)

### Customisable
It enables low-level access to potentially change _everything_ about the interface and how you use it. In this workshop we will use templates and community-made plugins, and even customise the interface with themes.

### Local & not a subscription:
by default everything is saved locally, not cloud dependant. They do offer a syncing service between devices, this is the only paid service. There are syncing alternatives that are free and not-cloud based [[README#Extra & Cool|Look in here]].

# What we're doing to

We will share some technical skills as well as some practice approaches that we find work really well. Some of these will refer to standardised/popular methods, but most will be a combination of different approaches we've found work for us. 

We've made a folder called "Demo Folder" where you can create the exercises we will be going through today or take notes on what we're doing. we will create a small collection of notes and files to create a starting point that you can expand on and start to test‚≠êpractice.
