# Situating "Making Sense with Obsidian"

## Pre-word (Share notes!)

We find shared note taking really helpful so we have setup a pad in [[Shared notes and questions]] with subheadings for each section of this workshop.

We will be talking about cultivating research through knowledge bases and how we do that using this tool called Obsidian.

## A little bit about us:

### George
Researcher, dev\*hacker, queer instigator and crip trouble. I am finishing off a PhD in queer and crip collective methods towards sociotechnical infrastructure and also teach experimental media, speculative computing and coding skillz at I-Dat, UoP. 
### Batool
Artist, hacker, educator and etc. In my practice I work with historicising computing within non-western contexts, and I teach at the CCI, UaL on the Creative Robotics programme. 

### Both!
What we're doing today is a tool that's been an backbone to help maintain how we work on everything, from research to journalling, and recipes to yoga for the past several years.

Both of us are also members of In-grid (artist collective) based in London, were working on collective methods and approaches of decentralised collective labour on infra \* structural transformation. We also host parties, skills workshops and events.

## Knowledge base & Research Collection

What is a Knowledge base? 

Well it basically just a simple term for a centralised system to collect, compile and work through your knowledge collection!

Our uses of this tool, in the context of research:
- note-taking
- A centralisation and management system of notes & ideas.
- using links, connections and data to create your groupings, rhythms and movements within notes. 
- Using different modes like visualising knowledge. 
- Relating knowledge to other knowledge, not just to when and where you learned it.

## Why we personally have a knowledge base:

We will go a bit more into this on the second day, but we find it really beneficial to practice our own methods for collating and collecting our research and knowledge! This is a way to actively practice your knowledge making instead of defaulting to existing systems, as it lets us learn what works for us and what doesn't.

- To practice organising our own knowledge, and seeing how that feels‚≠êworks
- Learning to create helpful way-finding, especially nueroüçÆdivergent learning & rhythms 
- Non-compartmentalising and creating a trans‚≠êdisciplinary knowledge practice
- Emptying my brain, not having to remember everything
- Sorting through information overload & overwhelm, creating steps, routines, cycles that we can catch ourselves with

## Why Obsidian
We are NOT working for Obsidian, and it is a proprietary tool. It is an _open_ proprietary tool with a big and helpful community who create plugins/addons that make it super flexible and adaptable to many uses and contexts. (you can make your own plugins too very easily!) The files are also all in [[01_General syntax|markdown]] so are easily transferred to another markdown (md) based software (there are many)

### Customisable
It enables low-level access to potentially change _everything_ about the interface and how you use it. In this workshop we will use templates and community-made plugins, and even customise the interface with themes.

### Local & not a subscription:
by default everything is saved locally, not cloud dependant. They do offer a syncing service between devices, this is the only paid service. There are syncing alternatives that are free and not-cloud based [[README#Extra & Cool|Look in here]].

# What we're doing to

We will share some technical skills as well as some practice approaches that we find work really well. Some of these will refer to standardised/popular methods, but most will be a combination of different approaches we've found work for us. 

We've made a folder called "Demo Folder" where you can create the exercises we will be going through today or take notes on what we're doing. we will create a small collection of notes and files to create a starting point that you can expand on and start to test‚≠êpractice.
