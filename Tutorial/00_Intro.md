# Situating "Making Sense with Obsidian"

## Pre-word (Share notes!)

We find shared note taking really helpful so we have setup a pad in [[Shared notes and questions]] note, with subheadings for each section already setup.

## Knowledge base & Research Collection
Our uses of this tool, being within the context of research, 
- note-taking
- A centralisation and management system of notes & ideas.
- using links, connections and data to create your groupings, rhythms and movements within notes. 
- Using different modes like visualising knowledge. 
- Relating knowledge to other knowledge, not just to when and where you learned it.

## Why we personally have a knowledge base:
- To practice organising our own knowledge, and seeing how that feels‚≠êworks
- Learning to create helpful way-finding, especially nueroüçÆdivergent learning & rhythms 
- Non-compartmentalising and creating a trans‚≠êdisciplinary knowledge practice
- Emptying my brain, not having to remember everything
- Sorting through information overload & overwhelm, creating steps, routines, cycles that we can catch ourselves with

## Why Obsidian
We are NOT working for Obsidian, and it is a proprietary tool. It is an _open_ proprietary tool with a big and helpful community who create plugins/addons that make it super flexible and adaptable to many uses and contexts. (you can make your own plugins too very easily!) The files are also all in markdown so are easily transferred to another markdown (md) based software (there are many)

Sandbox: Very customisable & allows low-level access to potentially change _everything_ about the interface and how you use it. In this workshop we will use templates and community-made plugins, and even customise the interface with themes.

Local & not a subscription: by default everything is saved locally, not cloud dependant. They do offer a synching service between devices, this is the only paid service. There are synching alternatives that are free and not-cloud based [[README#Extra & Cool|Look in here]].

# What we're doing today

Cultivating a knowledge base takes time (G: 1.5 years, B: 3 years) but today we will create a small constellation of notes and files to create a starting point that you can expand on and start to test‚≠êpractice.

Showing different methods of using the same functionalities, we will see this with using tags, meta-data, annotation, writing styles and linking. How we are using the analogy of the constellation; how does creating tags and systems inform the structure of the constellation? 

We've made a folder called "Workshop Notes" where you can create the exercises we will be going through today or take notes on what we're doing.
