## So what is a knowledge base?

#### A Knowledge base is a system/software to organise your:
- Notes
- Thoughts
- Readings
- Diagrams
- Plans
- Code
- Recipes
- And More

---

### So what does one look like?

#### WELL THIS!!!!!

---

## Basic Syntax

#### Now we will look at some basic markdown code for obsidian.

---

# Headings!

## Oh Headings!!

### And Headings!!!

That enable you to break up notes into sections and structure many levels of subheadings.

---

### Code Blocks ðŸ’»

``` shell
pip install cute-things
```

---

## To Dos â˜‘ << Lets remove this from 'general'?

- [x] Lots
- [x] of 
- [x] things 
- [x] still
- [ ] to 
- [ ] do

---
# Links
## There are many types of links ðŸ”—

[Web Links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) use this `[Single Bracket](followed by the URL in paranthesese)` syntax.

This [Internal Links](Cognitivists%20example.md) is created using the Markdown `[single bracket](parenthasis%to%title%note)` syntax.

This [[Internal link]] was created using more simple wikilink `[[double bracket]]` syntax.

--
## Links to non-existent notes

Obsidian can create new notes from links, so that you don't have to interrupt your process to create a new note.

Like if you are mid thought, and remember that this text connects to [[Related Concept | something else]] you were reading the other day. You can put square brackets around that to create a place holder for a new note.

> [! note] the title of the linked note and what appears in the sentence are diferent
> You can give a link another name using the `|` symbol
> `[[Related Concept | somethine else]]`
> This keeps your sentence cohesive as note titles don't always make sense in-line

### Embedding images through links
![Pasted image 20231204103218](../../Pasted%20image%2020231204103218.png)

That enable you to link to images and other sorts of docs!

--

### Embed links * videos + podcasts

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tc1Nm5kNWKc?si=11mBIn8CcX7UgHEx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Tagging

This is similar to social media tagging but you set the agenda!

--
### You simply use a `#` and word to create tags between documents.

These can be #inline or in page metadata (info about a note).

--
### You can also tag within annotations!

You can annotate essays easily with tags and keep track of trends!

like [THESE NOTES](../../../../ResearchðŸ’­/Reading%20ðŸ“–/Johanna%20Hedva/Sick%20Woman%20Theory.md)

---
# Metadata / Properties

Similar to tags, metadata can store information about your notes, but it can also store information about the file itself.

> [! Tip]
> Metadata is best used for information that you don't want to appear in-line with your text. 

--
## Common metadata:
- Date created (usually automated with Templates plugin)
- Title (can be automated by pulling from note name)
- Alias
- Author
- Citation
--
## metadata "types"
In comparison to tags, metadata can also store _different kinds_ of data, like dates and boolean data (like whether or not you drank water today).

---
## Why organise like this?

Because then you can start to see and search through you information in a much clearer way.

---
### As well as Graph view

That enables you to see a mapping of the data.

---
## Quick note on Addons

There are soooo many!

And they can help to transform what obsidian is able to do.
From:
- annotating pdfs
- download sub tracks from videos
- auto downloading recipes
- saving webpages for later
- organising you TODos
- And much more!

---

## On your own  for 2 mins try to come up with some use cases.

At the end we will aim to feedback to the group!

---

## Thanks for your time and please ask any qs now or after class if it feels more comfy.
- Start to imagine how you might use a knowledge for yourself!
