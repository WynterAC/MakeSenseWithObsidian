# Templates - Both

We looked at templates already when we talked about [[04_Research#Time stamps|time stamps]]. A template is any preset format or info that can be applied into different notes. It can be used to create the structure of a whole note, or to insert a recurring snippets of info.
### At setup:
Identify where in the Vault your Templates folder is. This folder will not be treated as other notes and will not come up in search results. That is because templates are essentially placeholders for future content.

> For dataview: remove templates from searches!

## Page templates
Create a "work log" daily template with properties.

For templates that setup a whole page, you want to make sure to apply them to an empty note. This is doubly important because these usually have metadata (or properties, or YAML, wtvr you want to call it) and that will only be read correctly when its at the top of the note!

## Inline templates: 
Dates, blocks of repeating info
