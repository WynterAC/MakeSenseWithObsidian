# Intro

As you saw in [[01_General syntax skills]] there are many ways we can make notes to make sense of different media and resources we want to work with. In this section we will be looking at some of the methods we have found useful for working within obsidian for research.

# Structures \* Systems \* Routines

For us as neuroüçÆdiverse people with slightly chaotic rhythms, it is good to setup dependable but flexible structures, systems and routines for ourselves to come back to when we feel ready and able. 

Obsidian with its flexibility structure lets us practice and learn what systems and routines work well for us individually. The skills we are showing here are more conceptual and higher level functionality, instead of a specific setup, so please adapt and transform them to fit needs.
