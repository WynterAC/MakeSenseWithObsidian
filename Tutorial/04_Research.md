# Intro

As you saw in [[01_General syntax skills]] there are many ways we can make notes to make sense of different media and resources we want to work with. In this section we will be looking at some of the methods we have found useful for working within obsidian for research.

# Structures \* Systems \* Routines

For us as neuro🍮diverse people with slightly chaotic rhythms, it is good to setup dependable but flexible structures, systems and routines for ourselves to come back to when we feel ready and able. 

Obsidian with its flexibility structure lets us practice and learn what systems and routines work well for us individually. The skills we are showing here are more conceptual and higher level functionality, instead of a specific setup, so please adapt and transform them to fit needs.

## What will we be looking at?

- Structure - some people may have already made their own directory structure, folders for reading etc. maybe necessaries folders for this workshop :
	- Folder Structure
		- Tosort 
		- Archive 
	- Data Structure
		- Properties: metadata for parsing different notes eg. Author, File Type, Website
		- Tags: can be used to structure the status of different notes eg. to-read
		- Discussion on using tags & properties for different approaches to working. It will different depending on whether you prefer to use Graph View or Dataview to create a big-picture look over your notes. 

> [! Reflect]
> Don't be afraid to change your folder to match your evolving needs!

- Automation
	- read it later: actually downloads page content!
		- get plugin and setup tosort folder
		- get URL to paste in 
	- quick add: quick tutorial for how to make a function
		- add pad through provided code block
		- see an embedded shared pad in iframe

> [! Reflect]
> What would you want to automate?
> How can we think about automation as a process of caring for our selves and research, creating time & systems for us to make our work?

- Annotation 
	- Annotator: Use plugin with PDFs
	- Embedded media 
	- yt transcript 
	- Zotero, quick mention and link to video tutorial 
- Ideation & Inspiration
	- Canvas + different layouts of notes
		- Plans dg. Teaching plan
### Writing approaches:
- creating your own text from a lot of reading.
- Miro boards offering visual links vs idea-based linked with hyper links in obsidian.
