# Intro

As you saw in [[01_General syntax skills]] there are many ways we can make notes to make sense of different media and resources we want to work with. In this section we will be looking at some of the methods we have found useful for working within obsidian for research.

# Structures \* Systems \* Routines

For us as neuro🍮diverse people with slightly chaotic rhythms, it is good to setup dependable but flexible structures, systems and routines for ourselves to come back to when we feel ready\*able.

Obsidian with its flexible structure lets us practice and learn what systems and routines work well for us individually. The skills we are showing here are more possibilities and higher level functionality, instead of a specific setup, so please adapt and transform them to fit needs.

## Structure 

Some people may have already done the home work of starting to make their own directory structure (e.g. folders for papers, writing, etc.). We are now though, going to explore in more detail the possible systems and structures to setup.

---
### Folder Structure

The files tab on the left, is basically the file system (vault) that these notes are held in, within that you can structure it however you want. This comes with the needs of your practice and so is highly different, but when setting up try to think out and imagine what your needs are? What sort of Folder system makes things clear, adaptable and maintainable?

>[!Oh!]
>As you get going the structure will change as you learn what works, but do put effort in at the beginning to think through what your needs are. This is because big changes can take a bit of work after you have lots of notes.

#### Recommended Files

##### Tosort 

A folder to dump bits to sort later! This is very helpful when finding bits on the go, or when closing allllll thooossssseeeeeee tttttttaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbsssssssszzzzsszzzsszzsszz.
##### Archive 

A folder to keep past projects and files to help keep your directory clean and more focused on present projects.

---
##### Attachments

This is where we keep all the files that are attached to each file are stored. By default this is set to be the base of the directory, but this can get very messy with lots of files in one place. We find that putting them in a sub folder of the file the note is in is the best! 

e.g.
```
Notes/
	Note.md
	Attachments/
		Img.png
```

>[!Oh!]
>If you want to see this not in the abstract symbolic text, check out the `Tutorial` folder this file is in. It has the `Attachments` sub-folder setup and has the [[cool pup.png]] for the [[01_General syntax skills#Embed Local Image]] note.

### Data Structure

#### Properties: 

Metadata for parsing different notes. eg.:
- Author
- File Type (note, annotation, podcast)
- Website
---
#### `#`Tags: 

`#`Tags work similarly to how they do on social platforms, but this way you create and form your own sets of themes and trends to follow within your own research. 

With this think about what your process might be for developing and maintaining a set of themes or tracking other groupings or sedimentations. 

Do you think it will be good to set the themes (or whatever you want to call it) before and work them out? Or do you want to read and see what calls out and falls into place? Or probably do a bit of both? 

---
#### Tag or Property?

The inevitable question! Should it be a tag, or should it be a property?

Well sad\*happy to say it's up to you! But there are a few minor differences, the most major being that tags show up in the graph, and properties don't.

## Automation
### Read it later: 
Actually downloads page content!
		- get plugin and setup tosort folder
		- get URL to paste in 
	- quick add: quick tutorial for how to make a function
		- add pad through provided code block
		- see an embedded shared pad in iframe

> [! Reflect]
> What would you want to automate?
> How can we think about automation as a process of caring for our selves and research, creating space, time & systems for us to make our work through?

## Annotation 
- Annotator: Use plugin with PDFs
- Embedded media 
- yt transcript 
- Zotero, quick mention and link to video tutorial 
- Ideation & Inspiration
	- Canvas + different layouts of notes
		- Plans dg. Teaching plan
## Writing Approaches:
- creating your own text from a lot of reading.
- Miro boards offering visual links vs idea-based linked with hyper links in obsidian.
