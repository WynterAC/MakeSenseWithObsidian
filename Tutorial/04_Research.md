# 1 Intro

As you saw in [[01_General syntax skills]] there are many ways we can make notes to make sense of different media and resources we want to work with. In this section we will be looking at some of the methods we have found useful for working within obsidian for research.

# 2 Structures \* Systems \* Routines

For us as neuro🍮diverse people with slightly chaotic rhythms, it is good to setup dependable but flexible structures, systems and routines for ourselves to come back to when we feel ready\*able.

Obsidian with its flexible structure lets us practice and learn what systems and routines work well for us individually. The skills we are showing here are more possibilities and higher level functionality, instead of a specific setup, so please adapt and transform them to fit needs.

# 3 Structure 

Some people may have already done the home work of starting to make their own directory structure (e.g. folders for papers, writing, etc.). We are now though, going to explore in more detail the possible systems and structures to setup.

---
## Folder Structure

The files tab on the left, is basically the file system (vault) that these notes are held in, within that you can structure it however you want. This comes with the needs of your practice and so is highly different, but when setting up try to think out and imagine what your needs are? What sort of Folder system makes things clear, adaptable and maintainable?

>[!Oh!]
>As you get going the structure will change as you learn what works, but do put effort in at the beginning to think through what your needs are. This is because big changes can take a bit of work after you have lots of notes.  

---

### Recommended Folders

#### Tosort 

A folder to dump bits to sort later! This is very helpful when finding bits on the go, or when closing allllll thooossssseeeeeee tttttttaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbsssssssszzzzsszzzsszzsszz.
#### Archive 

A folder to keep past projects and files to help keep your directory clean and more focused on present projects.

- maybe say many ways to do it but we find sub-vaults in the appropriate places are good. (e.g. projects, events, conferences, etc.)

---
#### Attachments

This is where we keep all the files that are attached to each file are stored. By default this is set to be the base of the directory, but this can get very messy with lots of files in one place. We find that putting them in a sub folder of the file the note is in is the best! 

e.g.
```
Notes/
	Note.md
	Attachments/
		Img.png
```

>[!Oh!]
>If you want to see this not in the abstract symbolic text, check out the `Tutorial` folder this file is in. It has the `Attachments` sub-folder setup and has the [[cool pup.png]] for the [[01_General syntax skills#Embed Local Image]] note.

## Data Structure

We were introduced 

### Properties: 

Metadata for parsing different notes. eg.:
- Author
- File Type (note, annotation, podcast).
- Website

---
### `#`Tags: 

`#`Tags work similarly to how they do on social platforms, but this way you create and form your own sets of themes and trends to follow within your own research. 

With this think about what your process might be for developing and maintaining a set of themes or tracking other groupings or sedimentations. 

Do you think it will be good to set the themes (or whatever you want to call it) before and work them out? Or do you want to read and see what calls out and falls into place? Or probably do a bit of both? 

---
### Tag or Property?

The inevitable question! Should it be a tag, or should it be a property?

Well sad\*happy to say it's up to you! But there are a few minor differences, the most major being that #tags show up in the graph, and properties don't.

# 4 Automation

By automation, we are not approaching this as a way of accelerating our work and getting maximum efficiencies, but as a way to setup protocols and rhythms for ourselves to easily keep somewhat uniform notes that we can come back to when we are ready and able. It is a way to take care setting up to provide simple and easy workflows for yourself! 

There are many many many ways to do this in obsidian, but we will just show you a few handy addons/processes we have found that work well.

---
## Read it later

This is a very simple example that I especially use when clearing my tabs and archiving bits I want to keep. It basically is a addon that adds a simple button that takes the URL you have copied in your clipboard and saves it as a note in a designated folder. 

A bonus here, if you are nerdy and care about energy expense of networks and accessibility of resources offline on your local computers, is that it actually saves it as a note in your vault! This also means you can write notes around, add properties\*tags and edit it as well.

![[ReadItLaterIcon.png]]
> ReadItLater icon in the left side bar.

Install it [HERE](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-read-it-later), or go to Settings>community plugins>browse and search `ReadItLater`. (Make sure you remember to enable it.)

---
### Setting it up?

To get started we open it's settings by pressing the cog in the bottom left, and then pressing `ReadItLater`'s tab (highlighted on the left in the image below). In here we can edit our setup!

![[ReadItLater_Settings.png]]

The main thing we have to set is the __Inbox dir__ which is the folder these files will be saved to. I normally use the `ToSort` we recommended making before. 

 Low on the settings is the syntax that the notes take from each type of site. We don't have the time to look through this but check out their [DOCS](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-read-it-later) on this page for more info.
 
---
### How to use it?

Two very simple steps!

1. Copy a URL of a page you want.
2. Press the button on the left hand bar. ![[ReadItLaterIcon.png]]
3. (Optional) Check to see if your note is there!

---
### How Easy!

See with these sorts of systems, once we have done a bit of setup, we can have a handy and easy tool to decongest and collect all our bits in one place!

I normally have a rhythm where I will close out my tabs etc when they are getting toooo much, and save the ones I actually want to sort through and work with. Then once a month or maybe less, sort through them and organise them in the vault.

---

## Quick add

This is a little more complex example, but hopefully once it is setup it will create easy ways to organise and maintain your notes! 

What quick add does is basically create easy commands that we can call. This means we can create systems that give us simple ways of organising our notes. This again is very flexible and hackable, so you can do lots with it, and we will be showing you a couple of simple examples.

Install it [HERE](obsidian://show-plugin?id=quickadd), or go to Settings>community plugins>browse and search `QuickAdd`. (Make sure you remember to enable it.)

---
### Setting it up?

Again to get started we open it's settings by pressing the cog in the bottom left, and then pressing `QuickAdd`'s tab (highlighted on the left in the image below). In here we can edit our setup!

# 5 Annotation 
- Annotator: Use plugin with PDFs
- Embedded media 
- yt transcript 
- Zotero, quick mention and link to video tutorial 


---
# 6 Writing Approaches:
- creating your own text from a lot of reading.
- Miro boards offering visual links vs idea-based linked with hyper links in obsidian.
- Ideation & Inspiration
	- Canvas + different layouts of notes
		- Plans dg. Teaching plan
