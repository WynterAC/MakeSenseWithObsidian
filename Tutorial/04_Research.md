# 1 Intro

As you saw in [[01_General syntax skills]] there are many ways we can make notes to make sense of different media and resources we want to work with. In this section we will be looking at some of the methods we have found useful for working within obsidian for research. 

---

# 2 Structures \* Systems \* Routines

For us as neuro🍮diverse people with slightly chaotic rhythms, it is good to setup dependable but flexible structures, systems and routines for ourselves to come back to when we feel ready\*able.

Obsidian with its flexible structure lets us practice and learn what systems and routines work well for us individually. The skills we are showing here are more possibilities and higher level functionality, instead of a specific setup, so please adapt and transform them to fit needs.

# 3 Structure 

Some people may have already done the home work of starting to make their own directory structure (e.g. folders for papers, writing, etc.). We are now though, going to explore in more detail the possible systems and structures to setup.

---
## Folder Structure

The files tab on the left, is basically the file system (vault) that these notes are held in, within that you can structure it however you want. This comes with the needs of your practice and so is highly different, but when setting up try to think out and imagine what your needs are? What sort of Folder system makes things clear, adaptable and maintainable?

>[!Oh!]
>As you get going the structure will change as you learn what works, but do put effort in at the beginning to think through what your needs are. This is because big changes can take a bit of work after you have lots of notes.  

---

### Recommended Folders

#### Tosort 

A folder to dump bits to sort later! This is very helpful when finding bits on the go, or when closing allllll thooossssseeeeeee tttttttaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbsssssssszzzzsszzzsszzsszz.
#### Archive 

A folder to keep past projects and files to help keep your directory clean and more focused on present projects.

- maybe say many ways to do it but we find sub-vaults in the appropriate places are good. (e.g. projects, events, conferences, etc.)

---
#### Attachments

This is where we keep all the files that are attached to each file are stored. By default this is set to be the base of the directory, but this can get very messy with lots of files in one place. We find that putting them in a sub folder of the file the note is in is the best! 

e.g.
```
Notes/
	Note.md
	Attachments/
		Img.png
```

>[!Oh!]
>If you want to see this not in the abstract symbolic text, check out the `Tutorial` folder this file is in. It has the `Attachments` sub-folder setup and has the [[cool pup.png]] for the [[01_General syntax skills#Embed Local Image]] note.

---

## Data Structure

We were introduced 

### Properties: 

Metadata for parsing different notes. eg.:
- Author
- File Type (note, annotation, podcast).
- Website

---
### `#`Tags: 

`#`Tags work similarly to how they do on social platforms, but this way you create and form your own sets of themes and trends to follow within your own research. 

With this think about what your process might be for developing and maintaining a set of themes or tracking other groupings or sedimentations. 

Do you think it will be good to set the themes (or whatever you want to call it) before and work them out? Or do you want to read and see what calls out and falls into place? Or probably do a bit of both? 

---
### Tag or Property?

The inevitable question! Should it be a tag, or should it be a property?

Well sad\*happy to say it's up to you! But there are a few minor differences, the most major being that #tags show up in the graph, and properties don't. 

---

---
# 4 Automation

By automation, we are not approaching this as a way of accelerating our work and getting maximum efficiencies, but as a way to setup protocols and rhythms for ourselves to easily keep somewhat uniform notes that we can come back to when we are ready and able. It is a way to take care setting up to provide simple and easy workflows for yourself! 

There are many many many ways to do this in obsidian, but we will just show you a few handy addons/processes we have found that work well.

---
## Read it later

This is a very simple example that I especially use when clearing my tabs and archiving bits I want to keep. It basically is a addon that adds a simple button that takes the URL you have copied in your clipboard and saves it as a note in a designated folder. 

A bonus here, if you are nerdy and care about energy expense of networks and accessibility of resources offline on your local computers, is that it actually saves it as a note in your vault! This also means you can write notes around, add properties\*tags and edit it as well.

![[ReadItLaterIcon.png]]
> ReadItLater icon in the left side bar.

Install it [HERE](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-read-it-later), or go to Settings>community plugins>browse and search `ReadItLater`. (Make sure you remember to enable it.)

---
### Setting it up?

To get started we open it's settings by pressing the cog in the bottom left, and then pressing `ReadItLater`'s tab (highlighted on the left in the image below). In here we can edit our setup!

![[ReadItLater_Settings.png]]

The main thing we have to set is the __Inbox dir__ which is the folder these files will be saved to. I normally use the `ToSort` we recommended making before. 

 Low on the settings is the syntax that the notes take from each type of site. We don't have the time to look through this but check out their [DOCS](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-read-it-later) on this page for more info.
 
---
### How to use it?

Two very simple steps!

1. Copy a URL of a page you want.
2. Press the button on the left hand bar. ![[ReadItLaterIcon.png]]
3. (Optional) Check to see if your note is there!

---
### How Easy!

See with these sorts of systems, once we have done a bit of setup, we can have a handy and easy tool to decongest and collect all our bits in one place!

I normally have a rhythm where I will close out my tabs etc when they are getting toooo much, and save the ones I actually want to sort through and work with. Then once a month or maybe less, sort through them and organise them in the vault.

---

## Quick add

This is a little more complex example, but hopefully once it is setup it will create easy ways to organise and maintain your notes! 

What quick add does is basically create easy commands that we can call. This means we can create systems that give us simple ways of organising our notes. This again is very flexible and hackable, so you can do lots with it, and we will be showing you a couple of simple examples.

Install it [HERE](obsidian://show-plugin?id=quickadd), or go to Settings>community plugins>browse and search `QuickAdd`. (Make sure you remember to enable it.)

---
### Setting it up?

Again to get started we open it's settings by pressing the cog in the bottom left, and then pressing `QuickAdd`'s tab (highlighted on the left in the image below). In here we can edit our setup!

![[QuickAdd Settings.png]]

There are a many different setups and functions we can do, and we will just show you the syntax and the a couple of basic examples.

---
#### Syntax

This is a fairly simple syntax, and you only need to use it once in a while  setting these bits up. The official  [DOCS ARE HERE](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/FormatSyntax) but we will show the basics. 

You can use this in a few places when automatically adding notes or templates but we will just explain it first. 

>[!Note]
> If you forget, it is easy to come back here when you need it and refer to 

---
##### Time stamps

These automatically set a time stamp on the  page. 

``` md
{{DATE}}
```

Outputs the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. You could write `{{DATE+3}}` to offset the date with 3 days. You can use `+-3` to offset with `-3` days.

``` md
{{DATE:<DATEFORMAT>}}
```

Replace `<DATEFORMAT>` with a [Moment.js date format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/). You could write `{{DATE:<DATEFORMAT> +3}}` to offset the date with 3 days.

---

##### Values

This enables you to create interface selections and inputs that will be added to a file.  This is great when we want to standardise notes easily, or create different hacky tools. 

``` md
{{VALUE}} or {{NAME}}
 ```

Interchangeable. Represents the value given in an input prompt. If text is selected in the current editor, it will be used as the value.

``` md
{{VALUE:<variable name>}}
```

e.g. 
``` md
{{VALUE:tags}}
```

With one variable name like this, you will be prompeted to input for `tags`.

e.g. 
``` md
{{VALUE:project1, project2, project3}}
```

With multiple variable names separated by commas like this, you will be prompted to select from the options (e.g. `project1`, `project2`, `project3`).

---

#### How to setup a command?

There are a few different ways to setup a QuickAdd command, but we will just cover creating a command with a [**Template**](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Choices/TemplateChoice) . This lets us define a few fields in a template that will then be prompted when we call the command.


---

##### Template

To make this quick, I have already setup a template for us to use with some syntax setup inside. It is in the `templates` folder and called [[meeting]] that has different parts of the properties having QuickAdd syntax to prompt you for or automate values.

![[QuickAdd syntax in template.png]]

Here are the values and when we add it to a command you will see what t does!

---

###### Adding the template command!

![[QuickAdd template setup 1.png]]

To add a template its fairly easy, you just follow these three steps:
1. In the yellow box add the name you want for the command your creating. I chose `Meeting Note`.
2. In the red box choose from the drop down menu and select template. It might be selected by default already. 
3. Press the `Add Choice` button to add it!

---
###### Edit the template command

Now you should see something like this:
![[QuickAdd template 2.png]]

To edit press the cog button to get this menu:

![[QuickAdd template setup 3.png]]

There are a few different configurations that can do a lots of flexible bits, but we will be using the basics. 

In this image I have already set the `Template Path` to the md of the pre-made template, you want to do the same. 

---
###### Test template command

We can now test this command to see what its like!

To do that:
1. Get command pallet out (cntrl+P).
2. Write `Quicj Add` and select `Run QuickAdd`.
3. Then select the name of the command you made!
4. You will then be prompted to name the file and fill out the prompts that are in the [[meeting]] template. 
5. Check out the new file that was made! 

You will hopefully have something like this:

![[QuickAdd template 5.png]]

---
###### Further Setup!

This works well, but the real power here is that you can also use the syntax and values you have made in the interface and use it to automatically structure your notes for you as well!

![[QuickAdd Template 4.png]]

To add some auto structuring like the setup above that:
1. Turn `File Name Format`.
2. Then add the name syntax you want for the file format. In the syntax above (`{{VALUE:Who?}} - {{DATE:YYYY MM DD}}`), we have the `Who?` value from the template and then the date. See File Name to see a demo of it working.
3. Turn on `Create in folder`.
4. Add a path, that can have a syntax in it, and then select add. In our syntax above we have it at `Demo Folder/{{VALUE:Project1,Project2,Project3}}/meetings/`, so that it will be saved in the selected project folder's `meetins` sub-directory. 

---
###### Again test the template command

We can now test this command again to see what its like!

To do that:
1. Get command pallet out (cntrl+P).
2. Write `QuickAdd` and select `Run QuickAdd`.
3. Then select the name of the command you made!
4. This time you won't be prompted to name the file but you will fill out the prompts that are in the [[meeting]] template. 
5. Check out the new file that was made. This time it is named  and stored  in the right folder automatically!

The folders and file should look something like this:
![[QuickAdd template 6.png]]

# 5 Annotation 

This is very flexible and enables you to practice a method that fits your approach of reading\*watching\*listening . Again, we are just going to look at some options quite quickly to give an understanding of what you can do, so do adapt and build on.

---
## Annotator (text annotation)

This is a nice plugin for adding and tracking annotations on PDF and epub documents within obsidian. It lets you add comments on highlighted sections or whole pages, as well as add comments, and easily export quotes, comments and tags to a handy document. You may prefer other ways, but this is a quick intro to this one.

Install it [HERE](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-annotator), or go to Settings>community plugins>browse and search `Annotator`. (Make sure you remember to enable it.)

---
### Creating an Annotation:

Creating notes on a doc is easy, we just have to add a `annotation-target` property to a note in our vault and link it to the file. 

syntax:
``` properties
--- 
annotation-target: <document path or url>
---
```
For a local file:
``` properties
--- 
annotation-target: BrittonPritchard.pdf
---
```
 For a remote file
 ``` properties
--- 
annotation-target: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13478.pdf
---
```
 
   
---
#### Getting reading!

Once this is added we can press the three dot menu in the top right and the select annotate to open it up in the reader.

It should look something like this:
![[Pasted image 20240524205210.png]]

You can then add a annotation by highlighting and the clicking Annotate like:
![[Pasted image 20240524205245.png]]

You can the edit in the side menu, adding comments and tags! (don't forget to save the annotation)
![[Pasted image 20240524205358.png]]

---
#### Bonus annotations print out. 

A bonus from the way that Annotator works is that you can see just the annotations and their tags by opening the file they are were made in, in the read view of obsidian and it should look something like this:

![[Pasted image 20240525072819.png]]


>[!Note]
>This is actually great for searching through the tags easily. Also the `show annotation` link take you directly to it in the text!

---
## Media Annotation

We saw a number of ways that we can [[01_General syntax skills#8 Embedding links|Embed Links]] and other bits of media in the general syntax md file. Here we are going to be looking at how to work with specific bits of media and some notes and tricks to do that. We wont go in depth, as some setups will take too long, but we will link videos.

---
### PodNote

[PodNote](obsidian://show-plugin?id=podnotes) is a great plugin for listening to, collecting and annotating podcasts! 

It lets you:
- Create libraries and playlists of podcasts in obsidian.
- Create notes automatically from podcast episode with info.
- Create hotkey to time stamp (with link to that audio\*time) podcasts your listening to.

Check out this tutorial [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGLfuN15uJY) for more info.

When you have set it up making notes on podcasts will look something like this:
![[PodNote.png]]

>[!Tags]
>Remember that we can add tags and link to other pages and content here as it is just a note!

---
### YTranscript

[YTranscript](obsidian://show-plugin?id=ytranscript) is another great plugin that lets us get the captions from a youtube video you are watching and get time stamps!

Once you set it up you can pull timestamped captions like this:

>[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYF--aQmrY&list=PLzqSUPRfRFb40cAwUEUqVszM5XFtuu-xb&index=8&t=515)significance of Crisis and update in New Media so I see crisis and update as Central to actually unhinging habituation so the idea there is as I argue um habit

---
### Adding existing notes/annotations

Of course you already have notes you want to add as well right? Well depending on how you have them setup will make it either okay to bring them in or maybe a bit more tricky. 

We will have a very quick look at two options depending on what you have at the moment.

---
#### Zotero plugin

This is actually very easy way of incorperating your existing zotero workflow or notes into obsidian. It has a lot of setup so it is a bit more of a mention than a description of how to use.

It lets you:
- Add inline citations in chosen formats.
- Paste annotations to a md note in obsidian.
- Transfer the tracking systems you used in Zotero.
-
