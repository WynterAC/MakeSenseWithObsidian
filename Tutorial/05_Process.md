As well as being a place to create and keep your notes, Obsidian is also an interface for _how_ you work. Everyone will have difference preferences for tools that manage their tasks and the time needed to complete them. This section will be more about setting yourself up for a basic workflow and time management .

---
## Tasks ☑
- core task plugin:
	- [ ] This is a thing to do
		- [ ] This is a sub-thing, it will stay attached to the main task
### Task Syntax 
- Is `- [ ] `
- but you can also insert a checkbox with the `cmd-L` shortcut
### "advanced" tasks
The core Tasks plugin is good for most things, but you can also use the Tasks community plugin to be able to add more nuance (and emojis) to your tasks like:
- [ ] priorities ⏫ 
- [ ] Due dates 📅 2024-05-07 
- [ ] Start dates 🛫 2024-05-07 
- [x] done dates ✅ 2024-05-06
## Calendar 
- Get calendar community plugin
- Can link to the daily notes which we setup during the [[03_Plugins|plugins section]] 
	- Set up time based tasks with due dates
- Extra mention: Task Rollover
### Structuring your Tasks

> [!Reflect]
> Think about where you put your to-dos, in-line within notes, on project Index, or in a time-based view (like a calendar)?
# Dataview
- Tasks
	- Querying all `NOT DONE` tasks
	- Refine by a certain due date
	- sort by `sort by created reverse` to see more recent tasks on top
- Tables: querying notes about readings
	- create table with all metadata as column headers to see
		- Author
		- Title
		- Published date
		- Tags
		- Ranking / Importance
## Tracker
- Writing tracker can be set up with the word count plugin

> [! Reflect]
> We are not trying to track for efficiency, but this could be helpful when writing on a deadline or you need to maintain a rhythm of daily writing, reading
