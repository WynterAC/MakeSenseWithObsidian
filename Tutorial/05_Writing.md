# 6 Writing Approaches:

There are many ways you can start to write, and work out what makes it easier to write and structure your ideas, as well as connect all of your thoughts, annotations and threads together.

I will be showing ways that I as a dyslexic who finds it tricky to structure essays and research into clearer arguments uses a few of these obsidian tools to stage essay writing into more clearer steps.

>This is for reference and think about how you can incorporate or transform your existing ways of working through these tools.

## Iterating Complexity
#B

Iterating complexity of notes by slowly adding to ongoing clusters of notes. This method borrows from "atomic notes" but is more fluid.
### Step 1: Resource-bound notes 

- This step is for taking notes however you usually do - through annotator, physical sticky notes, canvas cards. etc. 

These notes will only make sense when viewed in context of the original resource. You do not need to pay attention to making cohesive sentences yet. You can say things like "this is a useful concept" without naming the concept or what it's useful for.

This is usually the kind of note-taking we do when annotating [[CS-Annotations]].
### Step2: "atomic" notes

- Discrete, irreducible complete thoughts. These start to form idea-based links with each other

These are full sentences in your own words, that do not make verbal references to the original source. (eg. not saying things like "this concept is important", but names the concept) but keeps links to the original note or resource note. 

These notes should be comprehensible if read by themselves, but as they are still notes, they will have wiki links to other related ideas (that sit in their own notes)

### Step 3: Output oriented 

writing compiling those notes, links become citations. This steps usually compiles the content of the wiki-linked notes into one longer "page style" note

At this point, your notes are larger

## Mapping chapters/essays the Canvas
#G

Now this isn't a new idea for getting your ideas out there but through this methodology we can keep keep it together as one fluid and growing seed within your practice and maybe recommend some processes to do that.

There is a demo setup of this in: ![[Demo canvas_Chapter Planner.canvas]]

### My steps:

1. Make sure your canvas save your new files in the local folder to the canvas by going into sttings and selecting `Same folder as current` like this: ![[Planning 2.png]]
2. Create a new folder for your writing.
3. Add a new canvas to that folder and name it appropriately.
4. Open it up and add a new note into the canvas with this button: ![[Planning 1.png]]
5. Then write the name of the new file you want to make and press `Shift + Enter` to make it. This will create the file in the same folder as the canvas.
6. In this file I then do the following steps:
	1. Spend 15-20 mins blurbing out what I want to write without too much care.
	2. Spend 10 -15 mins writing that up as a one sentence question or argument.
7. Once I have the argument I will then structure out the rest of the essay into its subheadings and steps quite quickly, writing up briefly what each one will contain. Remembering to think of how they will be wound or woven back into this central question or argument. 
8. When you are happy with your first structure you can then focus in to each individual note to start to grow out these very clear pre-planned section and journey of text by themselves without getting too cluttered. You can also leave clear notes, links and refs per section as well and not loose them.
10. If you come back and feel like the structure needs to change, as it often does, you can then visually from a high level move these written sections around and feel what might work without getting stuck in the nitty gritty.
11. Once you are feeling comfortable with this essays structure and message, you may then need to add more complex referencing etc to it. I would personally move it over to a libre or office setup, but see what works for you. These steps are more about smoothly growing and structuring the idea.
