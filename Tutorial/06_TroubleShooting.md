Knowing how things break is the best way of understanding how they work! Some of these things will "break" your vault, here is how to fix them:
### 1 Changing your vault location 
- Go to Open another vault (Â )
- Click Open folder as vault & locate the vault
### 2 Renaming notes after linking them
- Go to: Options -> Files and Links
- make sure that "Automatically Update Internal Links" is toggled on
- If you are prompted to auto-update links always select yes
### 3 Renaming  or moving folders after linking to plugin
This is mostly a problem for Daily Notes, Calendar and Templates (but also any plugin that automates saving to or pasting from different locations)
- Go into the settings pane of that plugin
- update the name and location of the folder
### 4 Changing date formats
Keep all date formats to YYYY-MM-DDD even if you find it annoying. I changed it to dd-mm-yyyy and had to change it back after a few months with much faff and python scripting.
- Don't do it.
### 5 Changing the default config 
This is a more advanced problem for adventurers who want to override `.obsidian` settings, possibly to create extra custom profiles.
- Don't do it. Make a new vault or copy your vault if you want to test different configs and do that by editing the existing .obsidian file
